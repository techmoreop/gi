        <p> Roblox is a popular online platform and game creation system that allows users to design, share, and play games created
        by other users. Launched in 2006, it has grown into a global hub for millions of players and developers, offering a wide
        variety of user-generated experiences ranging from obstacle courses and role-playing games to simulations and virtual
        hangouts. What sets Roblox apart is its immersive social environment and accessible game development tools, powered by
        its proprietary engine, Roblox Studio. Players can customize avatars, earn virtual currency (Robux), and collaborate
        with others across the world, making it both a gaming and creative platform for all ages.
